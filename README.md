# seedgenerator

seedgenerator is a simple, standalone program written entirely in java that generates a range of "seeds" in hexadecimal format.

This generator is intended for use while performing RNG manipulation in Pokemon games. Specifically, it is useful during the trial-and-error step of finding your 4-digit hexadecimal seed. It is designed to be used in conjunction with another program that requires a set of hex seeds to check your seed.
